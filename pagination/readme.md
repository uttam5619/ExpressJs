# For pagination we required 
1. no of pages
2. page size


taking data from url params -> req.params.`[fieldName]`
taking data from url query -> req.query.`[fieldName]`




Doubts:
1. If type is string then why do we need to specify the no of charecters
because no matter how long the string is the size will be according to string datatype
